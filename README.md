I am developing the IDEAL Lab website for my research internship with Dr. Bencharit. I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I approached this project with a design thinking perspective. 

Empathy: understand Dr. Bencharit's needs for the website as well as what future students will want

Define: How can I create a website that highlights the IDEAL Lab's Goals and can help future research assistants with joining the lab

Ideate: Brainstormed/ researched possible pages and resources needed for a lab website. Created a sitemap to organize and structure what the website needs.

Prototyped: Lo-fi Wireframing. Started developing the website. Picked-out typography (Helvetica - simple, neutral) and color palette(clean and prof colors).

Test: Weekly check-ins with Dr. Bencharit and constantly adding new content to the website.
