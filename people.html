            My name is Lucy Zhang Bencharit, and I am an Assistant Professor of
            Psychology and Organizational Behavior at the California Polytechnic
            State University, San Luis Obispo. My research aims to promote
            positive outcomes for diverse groups in employment, work, and
            classroom settings. I am interested in how cultural factors may
            subtly and unconsciously shape our behaviors, judgments, and
            decisions. My research addresses questions including: How does
            culture influence our emotional values and behaviors? How do culture
            and emotion influence employment outcomes? How can we leverage our
            cultural values to facilitate successful work and classroom outcomes
            in an increasingly multicultural world?

            My name is Chi Lao, and I’m a third year Psychology student with
            minors in Statistics and Child Development. I’m still exploring
            different fields and searching for graduate programs that I’m
            interested in. The IDEAL lab’s research relates a lot to my personal
            experience; not only am I learning about the relationship between
            cultural values on emotions and leadership choices but also
            understanding more about myself as I embrace both the Chinese and
            American culture. I also love that I get to learn and work with new
            programs (e.g. Qualtrics and Noldus) as a research assistant in the
            lab.

            Hi! My name is Kristina Toma, and I am a third year Psychology major
            with a double minor in Biology and Child Development. After
            graduation, I would like to take time to continue research and work
            in the field before applying to graduate schools for clinical
            psychology. Being a research assistant in the IDEAL lab has allowed
            me to dig deep into the often underestimated impact that cultural
            values and emotions have on decision making. I look forward to
            expanding upon our research and applying it to workplaces, education
            settings, and much more in everyday life.

            My name is Lisa Bertholdt and I’m a fourth year Psychology student
            with a double minor in Child Development and German. I am in the
            process of applying to Graduate School programs regarding various
            aspects of psychology like the learning sciences, organizational
            behavior, and group dynamics. These programs would allow me to
            further my knowledge of psychology while gaining a specialization in
            something I am passionate about. As a Research Assistant in the
            IDEAL Lab, I have learned about the impact that gender and ethnicity
            have on teamwork abilities and strategies. This experience has
            provided me with great insight into the vast world of research as
            well as the experience of working with SPSS to run statistical
            analyses.
